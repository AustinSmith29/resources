## About UFOSC

### What is the UFOSC?

UFOSC is the Open Source Club at the University of Florida. We are a community of makers, who want to solve problems and improve our world using open source projects.

We were founded in the Spring of 2016 as an official student organization at UF. <!--The club is also a partnered Special Interest Group of the UF ACM chapter. -->

### What does the UFOSC do?

The UFOSC is first and foremost, about working on open source projects. Student choose what they want to work on, wether it be a totally new idea, or an existing project. Our meetings create a constructive atmosphere to help students collaborate in teams to grow their knowledge and skills!

We also preform technical talks on various open source topics. Anything from Linux to Typescript. Students are encouraged to submit ideas or even volunteer to give a talk. 

Collaborating with other clubs is another one of our goals. We love to work with others on presentations, events, or projects! If you are interested in working together email [gator.osc@gmail.com][UFOSC Email].

### Who's the UFOSC for?

If you:
- Are enthusiastic (or want to be enthusiastic) about open source 
- Want to make cool and useful stuff
- Want to improve your community 
- Just want to geek-out with others

Though we primarily work on open source software, you don't have to be a programmer to join. Open source applies to all sorts of fields, and so does this club!

### How to Join

## The Basics

### Meetings

We have three types of meetings. Check our [Facebook][UFOSC Facebook] for times and locations.

1. **Casual Coding Sessions** are laid back meetings. You can work on projects, homework, or just hang out! They happen twice weekly. It's a great time to find people with similar interest and create something cool. 
2. **General Body Meetings** (GBM) each feature a tech talk on an open source technology in addition to a brief round of project updates. This is great for anyone to come in and learn. They happen every other week alternating with Development Sessions.
3. **Development Sessions** start off with a brief round of project updates just like GBMs, before breaking off into different project groups. This is where things like: difficult challenges are worked out, responsibilities are delegated, and milestones decided on. They happen every other week alternating with GBMs.

### Organization

The officers are listed below
- President: Keeps everything running, overseas projects and administrative tasks. 
	- Matthew Booe
- Vice President: Assists in presidents responsibilities and in charge of tech talks. 
	- Will Owens
