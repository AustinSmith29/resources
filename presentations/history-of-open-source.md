# History of Open Source (WIP) 
 
In the time before Unix time, where computers were rooms, and every system ran it's own operating system, Bell Labs existed. The people at bell labs saw that, they said lets create a language that can work on multiple OS and architectures, and C was created, and it was good. The people at bell labs said let there be an operating system that could run on multiple computers, and Unix was created, and it was good. The people at bell labs said let there be a version of C that had Classes, and C++ was created, and it was good.  

Many years later, when hardware was smaller, better, faster, stronger, and computers lived on desks. Alas, the operating system options were poor. Unix and it's descendants were all proprietary and expensive. Of course their was Windows, but that was inferior in many ways, though that's a story for another time. There were a group of people who wanted an operating system to be like Unix, but free, both in terms of money and liberty. One that you could study, modify, and redistribute! They were the Free Software Foundation, and their operating system was GNU, which stood for GNU's Not Unix, because they wanted the world to know (and their lawyers) that GNU was not unix. (Of course that doesn't help most people, for instance I'm not unix...)
